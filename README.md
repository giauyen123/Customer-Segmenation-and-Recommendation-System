# Customer-Segmenation-and-Recommendation-System
This project aims to boost marketing effectiveness and sales by using customer segmentation. By transforming transactional data into a customer-focused dataset and grouping customers through the K-means algorithm, we'll gain insights into each group's preferences. From this, a recommendation system will suggest top-selling products to customers.
